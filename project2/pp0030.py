# This is the program written that creates an optimal binary search tree
# The technique of dynamic programming is used in creating the BST
# The information is received from a file called 'input.txt'

# the way input.txt is written is that:
# .. the first line contains the number of items (keys)
# .. each line thereafter contains the number of times they are seached
